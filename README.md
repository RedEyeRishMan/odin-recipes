Hello!

Once I complete this project I will have taken the first step towards learning HTML

I will demonstrate my early skills of basic HTML coding, basic git workflow understanding,
and low level entry into github. I write this so in the future I can come back and 
continue to add to this project with CSS and javascript once I learn them. Also to
laugh a bit at the mistakes I make that I'll understand more in the future.
